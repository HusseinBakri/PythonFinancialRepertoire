Description:
------------
A script that calculates the natural logarithm of single rate of return.
It plots graphs so we can understand better the concept.

API Used: Yahoo Finance

Requirements:
------------
Make sure that Pandas, pandas_datareader, numpy, matplotlib and xlrd are installed
no need for anything else

Usage: 
-----
python Calculate_Logarithmic_Single_Rate_of_Return.py
