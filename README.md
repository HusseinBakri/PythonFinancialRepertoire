# About
This repository is and will be a collection of a big number of Python financial tools used for Financial analysis, quant and algorithmic trading.

The tools used a variety of Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, pandas-datareader, matplotlib, mplfinance, statsmodels, zipline, Quantopian among others. Pandas was used for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas-datareader is a module that provides remote data access for pandas to financial API providers such as IEX, Alpha Vantage, Morningstar, Quandl, Yahoo Finance. Matplotlib was used for drawing graphs.

Please install these libraries when needed. If you wil be using pip, check first that you have the latest version of pip and setuptools & then install library in question
```
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# example statsmodels
pip install --upgrade statsmodels
```
There might be other libraries that you need to install such as BeautifulSoup4, xlrd, SQLAlchemy among many others. Please check the docstring of each Python Script.

While working on them I have learned a lot about the world of Fintech & finance. I hope also that you learn a lot from these tools! You can use them if you want when studying financial analysis.
